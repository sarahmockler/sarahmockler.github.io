		<h1>WHAT IS COLOR THEORY?</h1>
		<h2>In the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.</h2>

		<h1>What are the monochromatic colors on the color wheel?</h1>
		<h3>Monochromatic colors go well together, producing a soothing effect. The monochromatic scheme is very easy on the eyes, especially with blue or green hues. You can use it to establish an overall mood. The primary color can be integrated with neutral colors such as black, white, or gray.</h3>

		<h1>What is the color of harmony?</h1>
		<h4>Color harmony is the theory of combining colors in a fashion that is harmonious to the eye. In other words, what colors work well together. It is the reason the Hulk wears purple pants. It is the reason the original X-Men had yellow and blue uniforms.</h4>
